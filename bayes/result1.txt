write a python program to split a string with multiple delimiters
note : a delimiter is a sequence of one or more characters used to specify the boundary between separate, independent regions in plain text or other data streams
 an example of a delimiter is the comma character, which acts as a field delimiter in a sequence of comma-separated values
